# NotificationProviderWithCastleWindsor-
This solution is about sending notification.
You think that you have some applications (Campany A , Campany B ...)  in your project and have to send notification  
when a customer is registered at runtime. For example ,
Campany A wants to send a SMS notification when customer of Campany A change his/her password, 
but Campany B wants to send a mail notification  when customer of Campany B change his/her password at runtime.
If you dont want to use "if / else "  conditional , you can use castle windsor (typed factory facility).
